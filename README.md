# Demographic Drift in America (2009-2018)

1. Brief articulation
    - Population density in each US zipcode by chosen demographic
        - Racial or Class data
        - If US scope is overly challenging, may look at individual state level
    - Using census data (in the census Python module) from the years 2009-2018
    - Building a timeline map in D3 that shows changes in proportion of chosen demographic to total population in each zipcode by year.
    - Interactive elements: slider (to choose year), dropdown (to choose demographic), zoom
